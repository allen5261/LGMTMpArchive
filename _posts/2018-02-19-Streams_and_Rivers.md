非洲刚果河的下游，其仅320公里的印加河段，却有着美国密西西比河5倍的流量。那轰然如雷鸣般奔腾的流水，千万年来，让陆地上的一切生命望而生畏、退避三舍。印加河段那湍急的水流像无数急骤而力量巨大的鞭子，重则将鱼儿于一瞬间抽打成水浆齑末，轻则将那鱼群冲撞得七零八落，最终因各个鱼儿不能相遇，无法繁殖而消亡。多少年来，科学家皆认为这一段湍流是鱼鳖虾蟹等水中生命的坟墓，仿佛是地地道道的死亡之水。

然而不久前，进化生物学家对印加湍流附近水域中的鱼类开展研究，其结果让进化生物学家感到惊异：湍流对包括鱼类的所有生命个体都是致命的，却也孕育了若干种新鱼类物种。眼下，研究人员用DNA差异法，已确定了印加湍流至少孕育了4个鱼的新物种。世界上最大、最致命的湍流，也是生命的活水，是孕育新生命的摇篮。

人生亦是如此。人们无不喜欢平静，但是，波澜不惊的生命河流，充其量只能生活着一群拘泥守旧，固步自封的人。而在生命的激流中，消失陨灭的只是那些不思变革、过惯了平稳日子的人。勇于向磨难、挫折挑战的人，也就会有着超越自我的蜕变与发展。苏东坡曾说:“物固有以安而生变兮，亦有以用危而求安。”这里的“变”指的是变故，是遇险和罹难。“用危而求安”，甚或用危来引起蜕变，这才是大智大勇，是一般人很难拥有的。

**【摘自《思维与智慧》段奇清/文】**

Downstream of the Congo river in Africa, the Inca River, which is only 320 km, has five times speed flow of the Mississippi River. That thunderous water, let all life on the land be afraid and back off for thousands of years. The rapid water of the Inca River likes a rapid and powerful _whips_(鞭子), at worst, it can _smash_(粉碎) the fish into pieces, at best, it can let the fish lose their way. Finally, the fish will die out because they cannot meet each other to _mate_(交配). For years, scientists thought that the _turbulence_(激流) was the grave of life in the water, such as the shrimp and crab, as if it were the water of death.

Not long ago, however, _evolutionary biologists_(进化生物学家) studied fish in the waters near the Inca River. The results surprised biologists: the turbulence is fatal to all living organisms, including fish, but it also breeds a number of new species of fish. For now, researchers have determined by DNA differences that Inca turbulence has _spawned_(孕育) at least four new species of fish. The world's largest and most deadly turbulence, is also the living water of life, is the cradle of new life.

Our life is just like this. People like peace, But the undisturbed river of life, at best, lives in a group of _conservative_(保守的) and _entrenched_(顽固的) people. In the turbulence of life, those who do not think about change and are used to a _stable_(稳定的) life usually be _defeated_(击败). Those who have the courage to face challenge and setbacks will have a transformation and development beyond themselves. Su Tongpo said:" **The things originally develop change in calmness, however, there're also things seeking calmness in danger.**" The change here is being in danger or death. "seeking calmness in danger", or seeking change in danger, This is great _wisdom_(智慧) and courage, it's very difficult for the average person to have.
