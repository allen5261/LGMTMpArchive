**人民日报利物浦2月10日电**  2月9日，由英国利物浦国家博物馆和陕西省文物局合作举办的“秦始皇和兵马俑展”在利物浦世界博物馆开幕，展品包括兵马俑和陶器、青铜器、金银器、玉器等秦汉时期珍贵文物。这是兵马俑第五次来到英国，却是首次来到利物浦。博物馆刚宣布该展览计划，便引起了广泛关注。据博物馆统计，目前已预售门票超过10万张，预计参观人数超过45万人。展览将持续至10月28日。

此前，兵马俑曾四次来英展览，分别为1985年在爱丁堡，1987、1999和2007年在伦敦。英国观众对兵马俑非常着迷，特别是2007年大英博物馆展出兵马俑期间，曾吸引观众85万人，创造了大英博物馆自1972年图坦卡蒙展之后单次参观人数之最。

这次展览的宗旨，是让兵马俑成为中国文化的使者，为英国观众提供一次与中国“面对面”深度交流的机会。中国驻英国大使刘晓明在展览开幕式上表示：“希望英国民众在徜徉中国历史、领略中国古代文化魅力的同时，也能加深对中国传统思想和文明底蕴的了解。”
