“保护和弘扬中华文化，是我多年来的愿望。去年是香港回归祖国20周年，我把流落在海外多年的国宝《丝路山水地图》带回家，这是我的荣幸，更是责任！”2018戊戌狗年春晚，特别设计的“国宝回归”环节中，许荣茂先生的话掷地有声，回荡在春晚舞台，赢得了台下雷鸣般的掌声。

2017年11月30日，世茂集团董事局主席许荣茂向故宫博物院捐赠《丝路山水地图》，在故宫举行捐赠仪式。故宫博物院院长单霁翔向许荣茂颁发捐赠证书。这幅地图在上世纪30年代流失日本，一直被当作清代山水画收藏在京都一家私人博物馆，2002年被北京一家拍卖公司购回中国。

《丝路山水地图》绘制于明代中后期，幅宽0.59米、全长30.12米，描绘了东起嘉峪关西至天方城（今沙特阿拉伯麦加）的辽阔地域范围，它详尽记录了丝绸之路沿线城市在明代中晚期的名称，可以由此追溯到汉唐时期丝绸之路的走向。这幅地图负载了大量原始的地理信息，它的出现以实物证明了在西方地图传入中国之前中国对世界地理，特别是对于丝绸之路沿线已有清晰的认识。

在春晚上，故宫博物院院长单霁翔宣布，从2月16日大年初一开始，观众可以在故宫博物院官网上欣赏清晰的画卷图片。链接在此：[http://minghuaji.dpm.org.cn/details.php?pic=v04di475j6ul42yc031hf32l2fhr5yal](http://minghuaji.dpm.org.cn/details.php?pic=v04di475j6ul42yc031hf32l2fhr5yal)

"To protect and promote Chinese traditional culture is my wish for many years. Last year was the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. It is my honor and responsibility to bring the _Landscape Map of the Silk Road_ home, which has been overseas for many years." In the special design of the _National Treasure's Return_ on the Spring Festival Gala in 2018, the year of dog, Mr. Xu Rongmao's words hit the floor, won thunderous applause from the audience.

On November 30, 2017, the chairman of Shimao Group, Xu Rongmao, donated the _Landscape Map of the Silk Road_ to the Palace Museum and held a donation ceremony. Shan Jixiang, _curator_(馆长) of the Palace Museum, issued a donation certificate to Xu. The map, which was lost to Japan in the 1930s, has been used as a collection of the Qing dynasty landscape paintings in a private museum in Kyoto, and was bought back by an auction house in Beijing in 2002.

The map is drawn in late Ming dynasty, with a width of 0.59 meters and a length of 30.12 meters. It depicts a large geographical area from Jiayuguan Gate to Tianfang city (now Saudi Arabia's Mecca). It detailed the name of the cities along the silk road in the late Ming dynasty, which can be traced back to the silk road's direction in the Han and Tang dynasties. This map loads a lot of raw geographic information, Its appearance shows that China had had a clear understanding of the world's geography, especially along the silk road, before the western map was introduced into China.

On the Spring Festival Gala, Shan Jixiang announced that from February 16, audiences will be able to enjoy the high-quality painting picture on the Palace Museum's official website.
