2018年1月16日，我国新型深远海综合科学考察船东方红3号在上海江南造船举行下水和命名仪式，这艘科考船由中国海洋大学根据海洋科学精准研究定制并参与设计，多项指标国际领先。

“东方红3”船是我国自主创新研发的新一代科学考察实习船。船长103米、船宽18米、定员110人、实验室总面积达600平方米。船内配备国际最先进的船舶装备和科考装备，可开展高精度的全海深和空间一体化的海洋综合科学考察。　

东方红3号科考船配备了先进的水体、海底、大气等探测系统，遥感信息观测印证系统，化学、生物、底质实验分析系统，操控支撑系统以及船岸一体的数据与网络系统等；同时建立了与此相适应的通用、便捷、宽敞的实验室和甲板作业空间。

该船具备在深海大洋开展自高空大气透过海气界面，通过全海深直到海底的综合科考和资源调查，以及与无人机、科考船队和布放的其他观测仪器形成观测阵列的功能；具备深海大洋尖端海洋仪器设备海试和深海高技术研发创新功能；具备高效实施多学科海上实习实训、培养深海大洋创新型研究人才等功能。

"东方红3"号将被打造成为一艘以培养深海大洋创新型人才为首要任务，融合深海大洋科学研究、高新技术研发应用为一体的"旗舰船"。


On January 16, 2018, our country's new deep ocean scientific research ship Dongfanghong No.3 has been launched and named in Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard. This ship is customized and designed by the Ocean University with its research on _marine science_(海洋科学). Many _indexes_(指标) of the ship are world leading.

The Dongfanghong No.3 is a new version of our scientific research ship with our country’s independent research and development. The ship is 103 meters long and 18 meters wide. It has a _capacity_(定员) of 110 people. The total area of the laboratories has reached 600㎡. There're the most advanced ship and scientific equipments all over the world which can do _high-accuracy_(高精度) ocean scientific research of whole depth ocean and _spatial integration_(空间一体化).

This ship equips advanced detection system  of water, seabed, atmosphere, etc., confirm system of _remote sencing information_(遥感信息), analytic system of chemistry, biology and  bottom characteristics experiences, control support system, data and link system of integration between corporate and ships. At the same time, the ship has built general, convenient and _spacious_(宽敞的) laboratories and beck workspaces match these systems.

This ship has the abilities of doing compositive and resource researches from high altitude through ocean surface and whole water to the bottom of the sea, being detection group with _UAVs_(无人机), scientific research boats or other detection devices. It has functions which can examine and develop the high-technology deep ocean devices and multi-subject training, develop creative ocean talents.

The Dongfanghong No.3 will be made to be a flagship which has the main task of developing creative ocean talents, adding deep ocean scientific researching and high-technology developing.
