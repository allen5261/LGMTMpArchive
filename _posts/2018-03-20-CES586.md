1998年9月10日——十年以前的一个深夜，一架客机拖着一长条火花，在上海虹桥机场的跑道上缓缓地停了下来。机头浸在厚厚的防火泡沫里，还有消防车不停向机身上喷泡沫……在这个寂静的夜晚，发生了我国首次民航客机迫降事件——东方航空586号班机事件。

### 事件经过

现场视频（珍贵历史资料）：

1998年9月10日下午7时38分，中国东方航空一架编号B-2173的麦道MD-11型客机搭载了137名乘客及机组，执行MU586号班机，从上海虹桥国际机场起飞前往北京首都国际机场，然后再飞往洛杉矶国际机场。

当飞机起飞后，机长倪介祥发觉飞机的前起落架指示灯未能由红色转为熄灭，表示不能收回，当飞机升到900米时，倪介祥按照检查单程序又做了一次收起落架动作，只见红色信号灯仍亮着。于是机长通知虹桥国际机场塔台，塔台同意飞机返航。

当证实前起落架已经收回但放下起落架的液压系统似乎有故障后，机组人员欲在空中将前起落架降下。他们首先将飞机降下再爬升，之后再以小半径侧滑，试图通过侧滑产生的离心力将起落架甩下，但未能成功。经地面塔台同意，倪介祥要采取在空中“甩放”的办法。一套急上升、侧滑、大坡度盘旋动作做完了，但离心力作用并未能把前轮“甩放”下来。

其后，机长指示一名机务赵永亮查看起落架的状况，该名机务缠上绳子后冒险从前起落架舱门口探出身体，并用斧头敲打起落架出现故障的地方，但未见松动。

接着，机长用后起落架着陆，试图将前起落架震下但仍然毫无反应，结果唯有迫降。

晚上10时10分，机场及飞机均开始进行迫降前的准备，空乘安排乘客尽量移往机尾后方，飞机则于机场上空盘旋以消耗燃油，机场跑道亦喷上防火泡沫，减低起火的几率。

11时7分，飞机在前端喷上防火泡沫的跑道上降落，机长首先让后起落架先触地，之后机头在跑道上摩擦，并跟地面拖出一条火花，当滑行380米后飞机最终停下。机上138人全部生还。

经过近一个月的调查，客机空中遇险的原因已经查明，是飞机前起落架的销子断裂导致起落架收放失效。有关专家鉴定后认为，该飞机销子中某种金属成分含量过高，成分构成不合理，导致金属产生裂缝并在飞行时断裂。

### 涉事飞机

这架英雄客机是麦克唐纳·道格拉斯公司（已并入波音）生产的MD-11型，注册号B-2173，是一款配备有3具发动机的广体客机。在事故发生后它被修复后继续执行客运航班任务。2000年，B-2173被改装为货机，在中国东方航空继续执行货运任务。2005年加入中国货运航空。目前，该飞机已在美国戴维斯-蒙森空军基地解体拆毁。


### 艺术作品

这次迫降事件被上海电影制片厂改编为电影《紧急迫降》。

![alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allen5261/allen5261.github.io/master/img/posts/20180320/9.jpg)

这部电影是我国摄制的首部空难片，它用涉事飞机的姊妹机B-2174描绘了客机迫降惊心动魄的过程。机舱、机场等一切场景均较好地还原事发情景。

同时，这部电影也是我国电脑特技的开山之作。那时，上影刚刚斥资250万美金引进了一套电脑特技制作设备，这套代表1999年初世界最高技术水平的数码制作系统是数字影视制作的经典。对上影而言，这无疑是个需要胆量和魄力的大手笔。除了引进先进机器、设备硬件，还引进了一批优秀人才，成立了电脑制作公司。电脑公司尚在筹备阶段就揽下《紧急迫降》的电脑特技制作任务。

该片通过两条故事线索，叙述客机迫降时的详细过程。其中以客机起飞到故障到迫降的过程为主线，辅以地面指挥人员、地勤、消防等人员调集为次要线索，全方位展现了迫降时的上下配合、空地对话、点面俱到、纵横交错的故事情节。

最后以电影里空管的一句指令结束吧，向广大空管、地勤等辛勤工作在一线航空领域的人们，致敬！

On September 10, 1998 -- a night of 20 years ago, a passenger plane stopped with bright spark on the runway at Shanghai Hongqiao Airport. Its nose _soaked_(浸泡) in thick fire foam, fire engines also _sprayed_(喷洒) fire foam on the plane... On this quiet night, China's first passenger plane crash landing _event_(事件) happened -- China Eastern 586 crash landing.

### Events

Accident live video (valuable historical record):
<video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allen5261/allen5261.github.io/master/img/posts/20180320/event.mp4" controls="controls"></video>

At 7:38 PM on September 10, 1998, MU586, an MD-11 of China Eastern Airlines (reg number: B-2173) with 137 passengers and _crew_(机组) took off from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport _via_(经由) Beijing Capital International Airport, to Los Angeles International Airport.

After the plane took off, the captain, Ni Jiexiang, realized that the _nose landing gear indicator_(前起落架指示灯) could not turn out from red, that showed the gear could not be _retracted_(收起). When the plane climbed to 900 meters, Ni tried again in the way on the checklist, but the red light was still on. The captain informed airport tower controller, and the controller agreed the plane to return. 

When the crew _confirmed_(确认) that the nose gear has been retracted but there were something wrong with the _hydraulic system_(液压系统), the crew wanted to drop the gear in the air. They first lowered the plane and then climbed, then _slid_(侧滑) in a small _radius_(半径) to get the landing gear down by the _centrifugal force_(离心力), but failed. With the _consent_(同意) of the ground controller, Ni  finished a set of process of _sharp_(大幅度的) climbing, side sliping and large _slope hovering_(大幅度盘旋), but the centrifugal force did not put the nose gear down.

Then, the captain sent an engineer, Zhao Yongliang  to check the status of the gear, Zhao put on the rope and took a risk of going out of the _ear compartment_(起落架舱). Then he smashed the gear with an _axe_(斧子) but failed.

The captain then landed on the rear landing gear, tried to shake down the nose gear but still had no response, they had only to crashland.

At 10:10 p.m., the airport and the plane began to prepare for the crashlanding. The crews _arranged_(安排) the passengers to move to the the tail of the plane. The aircraft hovered over the airport to burn _fuel_(燃油), and the runway was sprayed with a fire foam to reduce the risk of fire.

>Shot from _Crash Landing_

At 11:07 p.m., the plane landed on the front of a runway that was sprayed with fire foam, The captain first landed the rear landing gear, then the nose _scraped_(摩擦) on the runway, produced a spark off the ground. The plane finally stopped when it _taxied_(滑行) 380 metres and all 138 people on board _survived_(生还).

After nearly a month of _investigation_(调查), the cause of air distress has been _ascertained_(查明). The failure of the landing gear is caused by the fracture of pin on the nose landing gear. According the expert's _evaluation_(审查), some metal components in the plane's pin was too high and not reasonable. It causes the metal to break during flight.

### Aircraft

>Picture from airliners.net

The hero plane was an MD-11 produced by McDonnell Douglas (had incorporated into Boeing), the reg number was B-2173. It was a wide-bodied aircraft with three engines. After the accident, it was repaired and continued to carry out passenger flights. In 2000, B-2173 was converted into a _cargo plane_(货机) and continued to carry out cargo flights in China Eastern Airlines. In 2005, it joined China Cargo Airlines. The aircraft has now been _demolished_(拆毁) at the Davis - Monson Air Base in the United States.

### Movie

The crash was adapted for movie _Crash Landing_ by the Shanghai Film Studio.

The film was the first air crash film to be made in China. It used the same-model plane, B-2174, to describe the _terrifying_(惊险的) process of landing. All scenes, such as the plane and the airport, were well restored.

>Shot from _Crash Landing_,the plane renamed "Bluesky 569" in the movie.

At the same time, this film is also the first  Chinese _computer stunt_(电脑特技) work. At the time, Shanghai Film Studio had just spent $2.5 million on a computer stunt _facility_(设备). The digital production system, which represents the world's highest technology level in early 1999, is a classic of digital film and television production. For the studio, it was certainly a bold and heroic effort. In addition to the import of advanced machinery, equipment and a group of excellent talents, the studio also established a computer production company. When the company was still in the process of preparing, it assumed the computer stunt task of _Crash Landing_.

The film drew the detailed process of the landing through two story lines. The main line was the flight from taking off to landing. The second line was the ground _commander_(指挥员), firemen and other people's _mobilization_(调集). The film drew the process of the coperating and calling between the plane and commander.

At last, let's end with a instruction of the air commander, I want to give the _salute_(敬意) to all the people who work hard in the field of _aviation_(航空).

>Bluesky 569, turn right heading 310, you can climb to the _altitude_(高度) you need...
